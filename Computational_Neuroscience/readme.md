# Computational Neuroscience Projects

This section features projects in computational neuroscience, combining experimental data with theoretical models to explore cognition and behavior.

## Projects

- [**Modelling_Hebbian_Learning**](Modelling_Hebbian_Learning.ipynb)  
  Explores neural plasticity using Hebbian learning models. Demonstrates implementation of synaptic modification mechanisms and their role in learning and memory.

## Key Skills & Tools
- Python
- Jupyter notebooks (like colab)
- Neuroscience concepts: Hebbian learning, synaptic plasticity

## Background
Projects here are inspired by coursework and research. They reflect applications of computational methods to understand neural mechanisms underlying learning and behavior.
